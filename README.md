## Hello, World! I'm Ashley 🦋 
I lead GitHub's **open source programs** team. We partner with teams across the company and industry to empower open source leaders and advocate for a healthy software ecosystem. I'm also on the TODO Group steering committee through 2026 supporting OSPOs everywhere.

Some of my favorite hangouts:
```
📍 maintainers.github.com
🏰 github.com/github-ospo
📖 opensource.guide
🔍 opensourcesurvey.org
```
